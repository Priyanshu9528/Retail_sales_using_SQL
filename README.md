# Retail Sales Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze retail sales data using SQL. The analysis is based on historical data stored in the `Retail Sales Analysis.csv` file. The SQL script provided performs a variety of operations such as data loading, filtering, aggregation, and querying to generate insights from the sales data.

The project uses SQL queries to:
- Load data from the CSV file.
- Perform data transformation and cleaning.
- Generate summary reports on sales performance.
- Provide insights into sales trends over time.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Source**
   - **File:** `Retail Sales Analysis.csv`
   - **Description:** This CSV file contains the raw sales data with columns like product IDs, sales amounts, regions, dates, and more. It serves as the input for the SQL queries.
   - **Columns:**
     - transactions_id
     - gender
     - sales_date
     - sales_time
     - (Any other columns from the file)

### 2. **SQL Script**
   - **File:** `Retail Sales Analysis sql.sql`
   - **Description:** This SQL script contains queries designed to analyze the retail sales data.
     - Queries to load data into a database table.
     - Data cleaning and transformation queries.
     - Queries that generate summary statistics (e.g., total sales by region, month, or product).
     - Queries that help identify trends (e.g., seasonal variations or high-performing products).

### 3. **Database Setup**
   - To run the SQL script, you'll need a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - Ensure the database is running before executing the SQL queries.
   - Import the data from `Retail Sales Analysis.csv` into a table named `sales_data` in your database using the following query:
   
   ```sql
   LOAD DATA INFILE 'path_to_file/Retail Sales Analysis.csv'
   INTO TABLE sales_data
   FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
   ENCLOSED BY '"'
   LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
   IGNORE 1 ROWS;
   ```
   
   **Note:** Modify the file path to match the location of your CSV file.

### 4. **SQL Analysis Queries**
   The SQL script contains the following sections:
   
   1. **Data Loading:**
      - Load the retail sales data into the `sales_data` table.
   
   2. **Data Cleaning:**
      - Remove any duplicates or invalid entries from the dataset.
   
   3. **Sales Analysis:**
      - Total Sales: Aggregates the total sales amount for each category.
      - Sales by Date: Generates monthly or yearly summaries of sales.
      - Product Performance: Identifies top-selling products.
   
   4. **Advanced Queries:**
      - Trend Analysis: Explores seasonal trends or sales spikes.
      - Region Performance: Identifies the top-performing regions based on total sales.

## How to Run the Project

1. **Set up your SQL environment**:
   - Install MySQL or any other preferred SQL-based database system.
   - Create a new database: 
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE retail_sales;
     USE retail_sales;
     ```
   
2. **Import the CSV file**:
   - Use the `LOAD DATA INFILE` command as mentioned earlier to import the sales data from the CSV file into the database.

3. **Run the SQL script**:
   - Execute the SQL queries in the `Retail Sales Analysis sql.sql` file to perform the analysis.

4. **View Results**:
   - After running the script, you can query the database for various insights and reports.

## Expected Results
After running the SQL script, you should be able to generate the following insights:
- Total sales per region and product.
- Monthly and yearly sales trends.
- Top-performing products .
- Seasonal trends or sales patterns.

---

## Dependencies
- SQL-based database system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- Retail sales data in CSV format.

---

## Future Improvements
- Expand the analysis to include customer demographics.
- Perform time-series forecasting using SQL or other tools.
- Implement visualization tools (e.g., Tableau or Power BI) to present the findings.
